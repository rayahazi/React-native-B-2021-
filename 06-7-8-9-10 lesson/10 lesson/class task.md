# Class task

There are two better ways to use the fonts in our app.

1. Create component with this font-family, and use it instead of `Text`.
2. Create file in constants folder `detault-style.js`, and use it in our app. (export the StyleSheet)

Make the two options in our app, anywhere we have text.

### Goodluck!
