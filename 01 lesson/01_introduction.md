## Notes about react native:

- In react native we must write flexible code (to fit all the platforms).
- There are not many basic components.
- Most components don't come with a lot of styling.
- New versions are always coming out.
- high dependency on third-party packages (they change!) -> happens less in Expo.

## Other options:

- Built real native apps:

  - Android studio + Java (android)
  - ObjectiveC + swift (ios)

- Built progressive web app:

  - Disadvantage: users will not use a browser, or the os will not support it.

- Use ionic or other technology (cordova):
  - worse preformance. (slower, more weight).

* There is also a use of: Flutter and Dart.
